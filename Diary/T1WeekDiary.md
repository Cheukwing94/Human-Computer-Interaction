## Week 2
I was starting to do the planning of the project 'Human Computer Interaction'. The first step I should require to do is awaring the history of HCI and the reason of learning. I had search some details about the HCI in the internet, HCI is mainly about the relationship between Human and Computer. There are several similar element which is connecting the interaction of a software. The main reason of studying HCI is improving the usability of software following the advancement of internet and technology.

## Week 3
I learnt more about the software process, execution and the elvaluation when designer creating a software. There is several principle and design rule we can follow for guantee the usability of the software. I considered some of the risks of doing this project and prearranged precautions or workarounds.

## Week 4
I read the book of 'Human Computer Interaction' which can deeply aware about the relation between human and computer such as visual channal with the computer screen. I listed the principle of HCI for the process of creating the software and the evaluation when creating the software which is a checklist for me to evaluate the elements of usability is completely achived or not such as flexibility or learnability.

## Week 5
I started pick up the file in the gitlab which add some notes, planning of the project and the software file inside the gitlab. I plan to design two software be a restaurant ordering, one for teenager, one for elder people. The difference between them is about the font size and the picture size for elder people would be more bigger and clearly and the website for the teenager would be more simple which would not spend too much time for the ordering progress because it don't need the step of showing food bigger and clearly. I partial finish the layout of the ordering website  in the paper.

## Week 6
In this week, I learn about the computer and interaction between human and computer from the book and finished the layout of the ordering app either for teenager or elder people. According to the supervisor advice in the meeting, I start design the website by HTML file with some HCI theory for writing the report. I realise the time management is not doing well such as the report are not started yet. I did the high time estimation. 

## Week 7
I had done the layout of ordering app for teenager and partial finished the layout for the elder people. I had used some css for highly presenting the feature of button and the food display in the webpage for the elder people. I had done some csss for the vision when user using the website through mobile phone.

## Week 8
I learn about the design process of Human Computer Interaction. I realise it is diffcult for me to compare these two software which is same topic with different user (teenager and elder people). However, I change the topic of the software which is shopping website. I did the plan of ordering app and shopping app according to the design process I learnt. The tools I using (HTML) which is quite old. Therefore, I change to use react tools to create the software which is more advanced and easiler. It is challege for me since I didn't use it much before.

## Week 9
I had done the layout of ordering app in this week. I created several component in the ordering app which is home `Home.js`, order `Order.js`, cart  `Cart.js` page and learnt about the usage of react-route-dom. React Route can create the own path for each component and add a link path to a button to connect the other component. In addition, I did more know about react through I creating ordering app. I use a better way for starting creating the shopping app and created several component which is home `Home.js`, search `Search.js`, type  `Type.js` page.

## Week 10
In this week, I finished all the layout of shopping app.
