29th September\
According the history of Human Computer Interaction, HCI is abpout the relationship between human and computer and focus on the user when creating an interface. The main reason of studying HCI is improving the usability of software following the advancement of internet and technology. It use for writing into a part of astract.

It deeply presents about the related stuff between human and computer such as visual channal with the computer screen. It is totally presenting interaction connecting human and computer.

13th October\
I list the principle of HCI for the process of creating the software and the evaluation when creating the software. It is a good checklist for us to evaluate the elements of usability is completely achived or not such as flexibility or learnability.



## Week 5
18th October\
I start to design the following software design and pick up the gitLab file. I design the first two design would be same idea of ordering website from restaurant. One is mainly design for teenager or normal people, one is design for some elderly prople who is not familar with technology.

19th October\
I write back the diary of the perious weeksand add some research from the website and the book of 'Human Computer Interaction' and I design partial layout of the website for teenager in the paper.

20th October\
I finished design the layout of the website which for teenager and updated the diary od Week 4.

22nd October\
I design partial layout of the website which for elder people. It would be similar with the website which for teenager. The difference between them is about the font size and the picture size for elder people would be more bigger and clearly and the website for the teenager would be more simple which would not spend tto much time for ordering progress because it don't need the step of showing stuff bigger and clearly. I am also learn more about the human perception when using computer like color or Fitt's law.


## Week 6
24th October\
I learn more about the computer function and the interaction between human and computer from the book of 'Human Computer Interaction'and drop down the note into the GitLab file. I design all the layout of the website for elder people.

25th October\
I start to create the website for teenager using HTML file. I design the nav bar and using color of yellow be the feature of the website.

27th October\
I have the second meeting with my supervisor. I should design the software with some theory for the report and I realise the time management is not doing well such as the report are not started yet. I did the high time estimation. Also, I create the nav bar of the food type under the main nav bar. 



## Week 7
3rd November\
I had done the layout of website which for teenager by HTML file. I did the food cards for each food type. Due to the restaurant ordering is mainly using mobile phone which like scanning the QR code by mobile phone in the restaurant before ordering food, I did some css style when the screen width getting smaller. I also copy the template from the website of teenager to the website for elder people that can change some suitable layout of the elder people.

4th November\
In order the name of the HTML file of the website either for teenager and elder people calling `main.html` will be mix up, I rename a more meaningful name call `teenagerMain.html` and `elderMain.html`. Also, I change the food tyle nav bar be a photo would be easiler to understand. the grid of the food tyle have a box shadow which even can know it is a button can click. Even if you cam use it by phone, they can see a big photo of the food type. I had almost done the layout the website for elder people. 


## Week 8
9th November\
I learn about the design process of Human Computer Interaction and write a plan about the following software I am going to develop. I realise it is diffcult for me to compare these two software which is same topic with different user (teenager and elder people). However, I change the topic of the software which is shopping website. It is more complex comparing the ordering website. I did the plan of ordering app and shopping app according to the design process I learn today. Also, I realise HTML file is quite old for us to design a software. Therefore, I change the tools I use from HTML file to React file, and create a branch call `ordering-app-menu` for doing the base of ordering app.

10th November\
I create the navbar `SideBar.js` and the food type bar `Menu.js` using a loop by the other js file which saving the name and the path of the menu `FliterFoodType.js`. That is more useful than HTML file which can easiler create a page.

11th November\
I create the layout of food display card which including the name, descrption, add and minus button for editing the quantity and the button of add to cart. This display food card is also using a loop from the other js file which saving the different type of food `Food.js`.

13th November\
I download a package of `react-icon` which can make the display card more detailly and clearly. I add a picture in the public and try to put the path in the js file which saving the food items `Food.js` for testing the code is work or not. 



## Week 9
14th November\
I create the home page `Home.js` which is for user can see after they scanned the QR code of ordering and download a package of `react-router-dom` for using the `Link` and `Route` element for creating the path of each page. I eidt the main js file `App.js` create the path of Home `'\'`.

15th November\
I deeply learn about how to use the `Route` in the `App.js`, so I mainly fix the path of Home and Menu page in the main. In the Addition, I create a feature for user to see how many quantity they add for each food item. It is an interaction of the user and software.

16th November\
I add a button hover which can let user know which food type are they looking for.

17th November\
I create the cart `Cart.js` for user to confirm their selected order and create a order page `Order.js` for user can track the status of their order. I realised a several CSS file is not suitable for a website. It might using one CSS file including the component will not be mix up the style. I refractor several CSS files be one CSS file. I had almost done the layout and the interaction of the restaurant ordering app and create a new branch for develop the shopping app call `shopping-app`.

18th November\
According to the experience of creating the ordering app, I learn that I should first add all the component I needed in the website and create the route into the `App.js`. It would be present the page clearly when I do the design. You can actual know the path and see the change I did. I follow the planning I had done before to add all the component. Also, I finished a login page `Login.js` and the page of create account `CreateAcc.js`.

20th November\
I start to create the home page of the shopping app. I did the Search field `Seacrch.js`, navbar `Home.js` of the whole app and the sub navbar `SubNavbar.js` for user chosing the gender before choosing the clothes. Considering the display can be flexible, I create a area which is some recommendation in the Home page. Also, I did the type component `Type.js` which can give user to see the clothes by a type that they looking for.





## Week 10
21st November\
I create the component of the cart `Cart.js` which simply do the layout. Considering the mess of having two branches, I merge the `ordering-app-menu` into main avoiding the conflix of this two branches.

22nd November\
I create the page of displaying all the clothes `Display.js` when the user click the type they are looking for and add the layout of filtering `Filter.js` and sorting clothes `Sort.js` inside the display component. 

23nd November\
I finished the layout the showing the details of the clothes `ClothesDetail.js` but there are some issue for the layout of mobile vision. It is not looking good when using the mobile vision.

24th November\
I finished to do the mobile vision of the display clothes pages.



## Week 11
28th November\
I merge the branch of `shopping-app` into the main and create a new call `improvement-development` which is for me to take some notes and write the report and doing some evaluation and improvement for the codes when writing the report.

29th November\
I rewrite the diary about the perious week which more detailly.
