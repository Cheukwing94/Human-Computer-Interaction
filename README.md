# Final Year Project
## Topic: A study in (HCI) human computer interaction

In this project, I will design and implement three different software interfaces such as websites and databases with one topic small online shopping. During the design, I will follow Normanâ€™s model of interaction. For the step of the design process, I will do research of user who will use the software and its requirements analysis. Building some specific guidelines for the design can efficiently meet the requirements of those users. Afterward, I will start designing the idea followed by the analysis of statistics and solve the issues of each different user.
